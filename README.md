Nevenote API


Assumptions 
1. Notebook name and note title are not unique. Therefore, use autogenerated id to distinguish between resources
2. Deletion/Get/Update operation will use resource id as input
3. Tags are case agnostic. Tag "A" is equal to "a"
4. createdDate and lastModified are captured as long miilis






Good to have
- versioning
