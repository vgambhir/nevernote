Nevenote API


Assumptions 
1. Notebook name and note title are not unique. Therefore, use autogenerated id to distinguish between resources
2. Deletion/Get/Update operation will use resource id as input
3. Tags are case agnostic. Tag "A" is equal to "a"
4. createdDate and lastModified are captured as long miilis
